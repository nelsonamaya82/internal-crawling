# Welcome to the "Internal Crawling" plugin GitHub Repository

A WordPress plugin to check how a website web pages are linked together to the home page.

## How to use this plugin

### Installation

1. Upload the plugin files to the /wp-content/plugins/internal-crawling directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

### Usage

1. Navigate to the Plugin settings page, located in the Admin menu (Internal Crawling menu item).
2. Click on the `Crawl` button to view the results. You'll see:
    * The websiteâ€™s root URL (i.e. home page).
    * All of the internal hyperlinks (you'll only see the home internal links in this very first version).
3. Optionally you can copy the shortcode from this same page and use it on any page you want on your website.

Each time you trigger a crawl, the results will be stored temporarily (1 hour) so if you come back to the plugin's settings page within an hour, you'll see the previously saved results. Anyway you can trigger the results all the times you want.
